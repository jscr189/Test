However, the mechanisms by which eosinophils migrate into the uterus and their relationship to edema are still not entirely clear, since there are a variety of chemotactic factors that can cause migration of these cells. Therefore, to evaluate the role of CCR3 in eosinophil migration , ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were treated with CCR3 antagonist SB328437 and 17β-estradiol. The hypothesis that the CCR3 receptor plays an important role in eosinophil migration to the mouse uterus was confirmed, because we observed reduction in eosinophil peroxidase activity in these antagonist-treated uterus es . T he antagonist also influenced uterine hypertrophy, inhibiting edema formation. Finally, histolog ical analysis of the orcein -stained uterus es showed that the antagonist reduced eosinophil migration together with edema. These data showed that the CCR3 receptor is an important target for studies that seek to clarify the functions of these cells in uterine physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><kwd>Estradiol</kwd><kwd>Chemokine receptor</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Menopause</kwd><kwd>Uterus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec-type sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The participation of eosinophils in the female reproductive tract has beenreportedsince the 1960s  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) . The first studies observed eosinophil migration totheuterus elicited by estrogen but not progesterone  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>) . In immature rats, this migration has been accompanied by uterine edema  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>) . Numerous studies have been conducted using different animal strainsanddoses and times of estrogen to promote these phenomena  2, 3 .</p><p>During the reproductive cycle, estrogen circulation promotestheincreaseinuterine eosinophils, and these cells are linked to tissue remodeling and maintenance of the normal estrous cycle in rodents  4, 5 . In the stages ofproestrusand estrus, the rodents are susceptible to mating. Thus, eosinophils infiltrate and their proximity to the epithelial surface increases when exposed to semen  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>) . However, eosinophils present in the endometrium during genital pathogen infection secrete IL-4 to promote vascular stromal cell proliferation and repair of injured endometrial tissue  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>) .</p><p>The relationship of endocrine mediators, particularly estrogen, in regulating cell development and pathways in the innate and adaptive immune system is well documented  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>) .

In addition, the CCR3 receptor is another important molecule expressed in various cell types of the human endometrium and leukocytes such as eosinophils  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) . The interaction of this receptor with its ligands, namely CCL11  eotaxin1 , CCL24  eotaxin2 , and CCL26  eotaxin3 , triggers eosinophil recruitment  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) .</p><p>These studies have demonstrated eosinophil migration to tissues using different<italic>in vivo</italic>and<italic>in vitro</italic>models. However, the actual participation of the chemokine receptor CCR3 inthismigration to the uterus as well as the formation of the edema that accompanies this event needs to be clarified. Therefore, studiesaboutthe mechanisms involved are necessary to understand the role of these cells in the reproductive physiology.Hence, we showed that the CCR3 receptor effectively participatedin eosinophil migration to the uterus of ovariectomized mice andwasimportant for the formation of edema under stimulation with 17β-estradiol  E2 .</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the standards of Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  National Institutes of Health  and were approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals of Federal University of Sergipe  UFS  under protocol number 38/2014.</p><p>Female C57BL/6 mice  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) – 25 g, n=5 – (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>) per group  provided by the Animal House of UFS were kept under standard housing conditions.
