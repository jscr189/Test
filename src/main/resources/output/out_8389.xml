affects more than 415 million people worldwide, being one of the leading causes of death in Brazil in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) . In type 1diabetes mellitus  T1DM , hyperglycemia – the most prominent feature of this pathology – is a result of both the impaired glucose uptake by insulin-dependent tissuesand the hyperactive production of glucoseby the liver, due to the lack of insulin release by pancreatic beta cells. This impaired glucose homeostasis is associated with multiple organic dysfunctionsand metabolicabnormalitiesin the liver pathways of blood glucose regulation, such asreduction of the enzymatic activity of the glycolytic andglycogen-synthesizingpathways and increase of thegluconeogenic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>) .</p><p>In addition to indispensable insulin therapy, there are several non-medicationinterventions that can be used as adjuvants in the treatment ofT1DM  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>) , butthey do nothinderthe progression of chronic complications and, therefore, the search for new therapeutic strategiesisnecessary. Among different interventions, photodynamictherapy  PDT  has been prominent in the treatment of neoplastic diseases  4–6  and neuropathic complications of T1DM  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>) . This therapy consists of topical or systemic administration of a photosensitizing agent  PS andits accumulation in the diseased tissue followed by local irradiation withlight at a wavelength within the PS absorption spectrum  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>) .Withphotoexcitation, the PS can react with oxygen and generate singlet oxygen <italic>1</italic>O<italic>2</italic>  and reactive oxygen species  ROS   (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>) , provoking cytotoxicity and photodamage, that leadaffectedcellsto death  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>) .</p><p>Due to economic and environmental considerations, PSs obtained from abundant raw materials attract greater interest than those prepared by complex chemical procedures  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) . Amongraw materials, chlorophyll  Chl isthe most abundant plant photopigment in nature, with chlorophyll-<italic>a</italic> Chl<italic>-a</italic>  corresponding to approximately 75% of the green pigments found in plants  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) . Structurally, Chl<italic>-a</italic>is a fully unsaturated asymmetric macrocyclic molecule with a hydrophobic character  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>)  that gives it low solubilization in hydrophilic solutions. Therefore, its incorporation into micellar copolymers, such as P123, which has been proven tobebiocompatible, is necessary for<italic>in vivo</italic>and<italic>in vitro</italic>analyses, since they guarantee the monomerization of the hydrophobic PS and the maintenance of its photophysical properties, which are indispensable for PDT  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) .</p><p>Chl<italic>-a</italic>metabolites are retinoic X receptor  RXR  agonists  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) . Research has shown that these agonists are capable of decreasing hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemiaintype 2 diabetic mice  T2DM   (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) . Therefore, it has been suggested thatChl<italic>-a</italic>metabolites could also exert such anti-diabetic actions  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) . However, the physiological potential of this pigment and its role in the prevention of chronic complications of diabetes have been neglected  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) .</p><p>Evidence of the accumulation ofChl<italic>-a</italic>and its metabolites in organs such as intestine and liver  17, 18  suggests that these organs mightbe affected by these compounds. Considering that liver functioning is compromised in the absence of endogenous insulin in T1DM, that hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are relevant in this disease, and thatChl-<italic>a</italic>may have beneficial effects, the hypothesis formulatedwasthatChl-<italic>a</italic>and/or its metabolites could have important anti-diabetic effects on this model. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological action of PDT, applied toChl<italic>-a</italic>, on the hepatic parameters related to energy metabolism and oxidative stress in T1DM rats.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Chlorophyll-based extract and chlorophyll-a incorporated into P123 micellar nanostructured system</title><p>The chlorophyll-based extract  CBE  and purified chlorophyll-<italic>a</italic>were obtained through the methodology proposed by Campanholi et al.

The results showed that T1DM affectedboth the cellular metabolism and the response of hepatocytes to PS. The results suggestedthat in CG, Chl<italic>-a</italic>increased the intracellular consumption of glucoseby stimulating glycolysis, which could then have been converted to L-lactate, whose production was high. In CG/PDT, the action ofChl<italic>-a</italic>stimulated the release of glucose, glycogenolysis, and L-lactate production, but did not affect glycolysis. In the diabetic condition, in the dark  DM , unlike what was observed in hepatocytes of healthy animals, Chl<italic>-a</italic>altered the metabolic response of liver cells, with glucose release, glycogenolysis, and glycolysis being stimulated.Withphotoexcitation DM/PDT , Chl<italic>-a</italic>decreased the release of glucose and glycogenolysis and maintained the stimulation of the glycolytic pathway. Thus, in the model of interest  DM/PDT , PDT withChl<italic>-a</italic>induced an adequate response to the pathological picture.</p><p>Metabolic results obtained from<italic>in situ</italic>liver perfusion showed that liver glucose release, glycogenolysis, and glycolysis were decreased in both diabetic groups  illuminated or not  relative to CG. This is because in T1DM the absence of insulin decreases the activity of the glycolytic and glycogen-synthesizing enzymes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>)  and, therefore, glucose utilization and metabolism become reduced  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) . However, there was no difference between the results obtained through<italic>in situ</italic>liver perfusion between the non-illuminated  DM  and the illuminated  DM/PDT  diabetic groups, except for the glycolysis rate, showing that they appear to be independent of the photo-excitatory condition.</p><p>Comparison of the results obtained with isolated hepatocytes  acuteChl<italic>-a</italic>  and with the intact organ  Chl<italic>-a</italic>chronic effect  of CG animals revealed that in isolated cells there was stimulation only of the glycolytic pathway, while in the intact liver glucose release, glycogenolysis and glycolysis rates were elevated. It ispossible that the wider effect of the PS in the experiment with the intact organ is due to the action ofChl<italic>-a</italic>and its metabolites produced after gastric digestion, once the degradation ofChl<italic>-a</italic>by gastric acid and the absorption of its metabolites as micelles by the enterocyteswere already demonstrated  11, 16 .However, considering the absence of fluorescence  Figure 3  after 14 days of treatment with CBE, it is likely that the pigments were not incorporated by the intestine of the healthy organismand thus the liver of the non-diabetic animal remained at the expected physiological condition for the fed state.</p><p>Chan et al.  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>)  observed that PDT withChl<italic>-a</italic>metabolites completely inhibited the growth of hepatocellularcarcinoma, while it did not affect normal hepatocytes. This observation is important because it agrees with the principle of PDT, according to which PSs selectively accumulate in the diseased tissue and neighboring vasculature, while their affinity for healthy cells should be low enough for them to be cleared from the healthy tissue  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) .</p><p>It is believed that in healthy tissues the triplet state of the PS is eliminated by the defense mechanisms of the cell, which can, therefore, decrease the effects of the PDT  33, 34 .</p><p>In DM/PDT, the results obtained with the intact organ were similar to the acute results obtained in isolated cells, in which theChl<italic>-a</italic>illumination reduced glucose release <italic>vs</italic>controls  and glycogenolysis rate <italic>vs</italic>DM  and stimulated glycolysis. The action exerted byChl<italic>-a</italic>in both protocols with diabetic animals – reducing liver glucose metabolism –indicateda potential capacity of this PS in aiding the correction of glycemia. This, together with the high fluorescence observed inside those animals treated with the extract, indicatedthe possibility of increased permeation of the PS in the intestine and hepatic action similar to the direct action of the PS on the isolated hepatocytes. It is important to note thatChl<italic>-a</italic>PDT stimulated glycolysis in both experimental protocols with T1DM animals, a pathway known to be depressed in the diabetic condition in the absence of insulin  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>) . Koch and Deo  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)  were the first to relateChlas a nutritional supplement in the control of hyperglycemic conditions in T2DM. Their study, conducted<italic>in vitro</italic>, reported the inhibitory effect ofChlon the intestinal enzyme alpha-glucosidase, responsible for the digestion and absorption of dietary glucose.The authorssuggested that inhibition of this enzyme could reduce the glucose content absorbed in such a way as to prevent postprandial peak glycemia and contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.</p><p>However, the results presented in Table 1 showed thattreatment with CBE as a source ofChl<italic>-a</italic>in the absence of illumination did not affect postprandial glycemia nor the weight of the animals beyond the alteration caused by the diabetic condition itself.Therefore, the effects observed<italic>in vitro</italic>in T2DM  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)  were not reproduced<italic>in vivo</italic>in experimental T1DM animals. In research conducted with<italic>Caenorhabditiselegans</italic>treated withPheid, a metabolite ofChl<italic>-a</italic>, and light exposure, a reduction in fat mass was observed  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) . However, this effect was only perceptible under illumination, which would explain the fact that in this study there was no change in body weight induced by treatment with CBE in the dark. Likewise, in the absence ofphotostimulation, the treatment did not cause changesin AST and ALT levels of the diabetic animals. These results imply the need of photoirradiation on PSs to stimulate their biological activity.</p><p>Important changes were also found in the evaluation of oxidative stress. The results showedthat the treatment of diabetic animals with CBE alone was not enough to reduce oxidative stress in the liver. Thiswasobserved by the higher levels of carbonylated proteins and ROS, together with less activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and SOD in the homogenate of perfused livers in the absence of light stimulus. However, in livers perfused underphotostimulation DM/PDT , hepatic oxidative stress was reduced, as observed by lower levels of TBARS, carbonylated proteins, and ROS. Thus, PDT was beneficial in reducing the oxidative stress of the intact liver.</p><p>PDTstates that, by photostimulationin the presence of oxygen, the PS can participate in the process of electron or energy transfer, forming free radicals or ROS  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>) . However, valuation of ROS in this study revealedthat light did not increase oxidative stress. In addition, levels of carbonylated proteins  which appear to be more adequate than TBARS to assess tissue oxidative damage, since they are more sensitive to both diabetes and the light stimulus  were reduced by 36% in DM/PDT compared to DM. This result corroborates those observed by Zhang et al.  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>)  in<italic>Caenorhabditiselegans</italic>treated withPheidand exposed to illumination, in which an 80% reduction in carbonylated protein levels was detected.</p><p>Furthermore, the livers of DM animals presented higher levels of GSH than the livers of non-diabetic animals also treated with CBE and in the dark  CG , a result that apparently suggestedthat the treatment with the extractwasonlyenough to raise GSH levels in diabetes. However, this increase was not sufficient to improve hepatic oxidative damage, which only occurred when the light stimulus was applied.</p><p>The results of this study are still insufficient to determine the mechanism by which liverphotostimulation triggered an improvement in oxidative stress. However, it seems to be due to the stimulation of a part of the antioxidant system, that is, by the increase incatalaseactivity. Although there are reports that the direct antioxidant activity ofChl<italic>-a</italic>is low due to its high chemical instability  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) , the results of this study indicateda promising antioxidant capacity of CBE stimulated by PDT.</p><p>The PDT applied toChl<italic>-a</italic>, directly on hepatic cells and indirectly in the liver by oral administration of theChl<italic>-a</italic>-rich extract, improvedthe general condition of the liver and of hepatocytes isolated from T1DM rats and, in this way, it is promising asan alternative and/or complementary treatment to T1DM.Unraveling theChl<italic>-a</italic>mechanisms of action on the liver – possibly mediated by RXR agonism  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)  – will improve the knowledge of these anti-diabetic effects ofChl<italic>-a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) .</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the technical staff of the Laboratory of Physiology, Laboratory of Chemistry, and Laboratory of Liver Metabolism and Radioisotopesof the State University ofMaringá.They also thankFundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico for financial management.</p></sec-type></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><mixed-citation>1.
