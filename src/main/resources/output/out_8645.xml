I n this prospective study, 57 consecutive patients scheduled for thoracoscopic surgery were enrolled. Patients were sedated with dexmedetomidine and anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil. Ropivacaine was used for intercostal nerve and paravertebral block. Lidocaine was used for vagal block. The primary outcomes were mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (ETCO 2 ) at T0 (pre-anesthesia), T1 (immediately after laryngeal mask/nasopharyngeal airway placement), T2 (immediately after skin incision), T3 (10 min after opening the chest), T4 (end of surgery), and T5 (immediately after laryngeal mask/nasopharyngeal airway removal). One patient required conversion to intubation, 15 developed intraoperative hypotension , and two had hypoxemia. MAP at T0 and T5 was higher than at T1 – T4; MAP at T3 was lower (P&lt;0.05<italic>vs</italic>other time points). HR at T0 and T5 was higher (P&lt;0.05<italic>vs</italic>other time points).

Intubated surgery under general anesthesia with one-lung ventilation is now recognized as a routine methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) .Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery  VATS  is a minimally invasive technique and is conventionally used in intubated patients under general anesthesia. During VATS, one-lung ventilation can be achieved using a bronchial blocker or a double-lumen tube. Because intubation and general anesthesia are not without risks, there has been increasing interest in the use of thoracic surgery without tracheal intubation to achieve a stable perioperative status and complete the treatment in patients at high risk of complications during intubated general anesthesia. Encouragingly, non-intubated thoracoscopic procedures are feasible and safe for multiple thoracic diseases such as resection of lungparenchyma for pulmonary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>) , biopsy of interstitial lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>) , bullectomyfor pneumothorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref>) , decortication for thoracic empyema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B05">5</xref>) , andexcision of mediastinal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>) .</p><p>Conventional surgery with double-lumen intubation is not recommended for those who do not require lung isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>) .Non-intubated thoracoscopic procedures are distinct from conventional intubated surgery under general anesthesia in that the patientis able tobreathe spontaneously under regional anesthesia 2, 3, 8, 9 .Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery avoids the need for tracheal intubation, lung isolation devices, neuromuscular blocking agents, and mechanical ventilation, thereby lowering the risks of complications such as lung infection, lung injury, cardiac dysfunction, and bronchospasm 10, 11 .Even biopsies for interstitial lung disease performed under intubated general anesthesia are associated with a mortality and morbidityof 5.8 and 14.7%, respectively 12, 13 , highlighting the need for the development of less invasive surgical procedures.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies regarding the use of non-intubated anesthesia for thoracic operations. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to assess the feasibility and safety of non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery in spontaneously breathing patients, using regional block analgesia.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>This was a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study of consecutive patients scheduled for thoracoscopic surgery between April 2013 and June 2015 at the Department of Anesthesiology of Shenzhen People ' s Hospital  China .

The patient was placed in the lateral position  pulmonary surgery , supine position  mediastinal surgery , or beach chair position  thoracic sympathicotomy for palmar hyperhidrosis . Scopolamine  0.3 mg  was given by intravenous injection. Electrocardiogram and oxygen saturation  SPO<sub>2</sub>  were strictly monitored throughout the procedure. Radial artery puncture was performed under topical anesthesia to sample arterial blood and allow direct measurement of arterial blood pressure. Dexmed etomidine hydrochloride  1.0 µ g· kg<sup>–1</sup>· h<sup>–1</sup>; lot #16120832; Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd . , China  was given for sedation, using a venous pump. Propofol  lot #1612099, AstraZeneca, UK  and remifentanil  Renfu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, China  were administered 10 min later for anesthesia and analgesia using a target-controlled infusion  TCI  pump. The rate of the TCI was adjusted according to the bispectral index  BIS   monitored throughout surgery , breathing, circulatory parameters, and responses to surgical stimuli, based on the anesthesiologist ' s experience. When the BIS index reached 50±10, a laryngeal mask airway was used for patients undergoing surgery for mediastinal tumor or palmar hyperhidrosis, while a nasopharyngeal airway was used for those undergoing pulmonary lobectomy or lung wedge resection. The anesthesia machine was used to deliver 50% oxygen at 5 L/min. The end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide  ETCO<sub>2</sub>  was measured using a sampling tube connected to the airway. Prior to surgery, the TCI rate was adjusted to ensure a BIS value of 40–55.</p><p>Intercostal nerve block was performed using 8 mL of 0.4% ropivacaine  AstraZeneca  for each segment. For patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy, segmentectomy, or lung wedge resection, paravertebral block was achieved with 0.4% ropivacaine  3 mL for each segment  to the T4–T6 segments. Another round of paravertebral block and vagal block was administered if the surgery lasted &gt;150 min. Intrathoracic vagal block with 3 mL of 2% lidocaine was used to prevent coughing during thoracoscopy  Figure 1 . (3 mL for each segment) to the T4–T6 segments.

Bilateral sympathicotomy was performed under thoracoscopy for patients diagnosed with palmar hyperhidrosis.</p><p>Intraoperatively, mean arterial pressure  MAP  was maintained at &gt;55 mmHg, and dopamine was administered if necessary. At the end of surgery, the TCI rate of propofol was gradually reduced. The administration of propofol , remifentanil , and dexmedetomidine was stopped within 3 min of skin suture. The laryngeal mask or nasopharyngeal airway was removed after awakening.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>The following baseline characteristics were recorded: age, sex, and indication for surgery. MAP, HR, SPO<sub>2</sub>, and ETCO<sub>2</sub>were recorded at the following time points: before the induction of anesthesia  pre-anesthesia , immediately after placing the airway  airway insertion , immediately after skin incision  skin incision , 10 min after opening the chest cavity  10 min post-chest access , immediately after the end of surgery  post-surgery , and immediately after removal of the airway  airway removal . Blood gas analysis was performed using blood from the radial artery before anesthesia , 30 min after opening the chest cavity, and 5 min after consciousness recovery. These time points were chosen to reflect blood gas composition before, during, and after anesthesia. The duration of surgery was defined as from anesthesia induction to removal of the airway . The Quality of Recovery-15  QoR-15  scale  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>)  and the Visual Analog Scale  VAS  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)  were used to evaluate recovery and pain status at 6 and 24 h after surgery. The two scales were administered by the same clinician with 10 years of experience in anesthesiology. The QoR-15 scale uses 15 questions to assess five domains of patient-reported health status  pain, physical comfort, physical independence, psychological support, and emotional state ; the score ranges from 0  very poor recove ry  to 150  excellent recovery  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) .

One case was excluded from the analysis because of conversion to double-lumen endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation due to injury to a pulmonary artery branch that caused a massive hemorrhage; the conversion to general anesthesia, intubation, and one-lung ventilation in this patient was deemed necessary to ensure a clear surgical field and to stop the hemorrhage quickly.</p><p>In all 13 patients with mediastinal tumor, pathology revealed a thymoma and lymph node dissection was not performed.

An important finding was that paravertebral and thoracic vagal block could be achieved successfully under direct vision throughathoracoscope. Intraoperative and postoperative complications related to non-intubated anesthesia were uncommon and non-serious, with only one patient requiring conversion to intubated anesthesia due to hemorrhage. These results suggest that non-intubated anesthesia for thoracoscopic surgerywasfeasible and safe.</p><p>Only a small number of previous studies explored the use of non-intubated anesthesia for thoracic surgery  summarized inSupplementary Table S1 , with most of these focusing on epidural anesthesia. Thoracoscopic surgery under epidural anesthesia has been reported to be safe and effective, with previous studies describing no major perioperativeor postoperative complications 2, 6, 8, 9, 16–20 .Compared with conventional techniques using intubated generalanesthesia and one-lung ventilation, non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery with epidural anesthesia has been reported to have advantages that include shorter operation time, better patient satisfaction, less nursing care, shorter postoperative fasting time, shorter duration of antibiotic use, shorter hospital stay, and lower rate of sore throat 2, 8, 9, 17, 18 .Other clinical investigations demonstrated the feasibility and safety of non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery with paravertebral or intercostal nerve block 3, 5, 21–23 .Most studies of non-intubated regional block and epidural anesthesia found both methods to be broadly comparablewith regard tofeasibility, safety, and cost 3, 5, 21 , although one study reported advantages of regional block that included faster induction of anesthesia, shorter operation time, shorter duration of chest tube drainage, more stable intraoperative hemodynamics, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stay  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) .Previously reported values for the rate of conversion to intubated general anesthesia have ranged from 0–10% 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 16–24 , supporting the value determined in the present study  &lt;2% . In addition, the mean operation time in this study  117 min  wassimilar tothat described inother publications  69–185 min 6, 16, 19, 22, 23 .Taken together, these results indicate that non-intubated anesthesia for thoracoscopic surgery is feasible and safe.</p><p>Cephalic displacement of the diaphragm during conventional intubated general anesthesia causes a decrease in functional residual capacity, and mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure is required to maintain sufficient ventilation and avoid atelectasis of the dependent lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) .In contrast, non-intubated VATSallowspatients to breathe spontaneously, reducing the impact on diaphragmatic function and functional residual capacity of the dependent lung  26, 27 .In the present study, 55 of the 57 patients maintained SPO<italic>2</italic>&gt;98% throughout the procedure. The remaining two patients had mediastinal tumors and presented with intraoperative hypoxemia  SPO<italic>2</italic>&lt;90%  due to surgical injury to the contralateral pleura, leading to an artificial pneumothorax and some collapse of the non-operated lung; their SPO<italic>2</italic>was successfully restored after repair of the pleural injury and assisted ventilation. The low rate of intraoperative hypoxemia in this studyis in agreementwith previous investigations  9, 21, 22 .Thus, SPO<italic>2</italic>can be maintained at a relatively high level inthe majority ofpatients treated with thoracoscopic surgery under non-intubated anesthesia. On the other hand, in this study, all patients presented with carbon dioxide accumulation. ETCO<italic>2</italic>ranged from 60–70 mmHg, although in one patient ETCO<italic>2</italic>reached 80 mmHg. Although the occurrence of hypercapnia did not result in any complications and ETCO<italic>2</italic>recovered to preoperative levels by 5 min after completion of surgery, attention should be paid to this potential issue.</p><p>Since hypoxia and hypercapnia remain a risk in spontaneously breathing patients undergoing non-intubated anesthesia, establishing an artificial airway is important to ensure patient safety. We selected a laryngeal mask or nasopharyngeal airway for this purpose. We recommend a laryngeal mask for patients with mediastinal tumors and those with palmar hyperhidrosis, for whom the surgical incision is extremely small and more time is needed to control breathing during the expulsion of residual gas from the thorax. For patients undergoing lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection of the lung, wesuggest that a nasopharyngeal airwayispreferable. Further research will be needed to establish the optimal technique.</p><p>Many patients in this study showed intraoperative hypotension, especially those with palmar hyperhidrosis undergoing bilateral sympathicotomy. The high incidence of hypotension may be associated with mediastinal swing  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>) , in part caused by the injection of carbon dioxide to facilitate lung collapse and enlarge the visual field. Other factors possibly contributing to hypotension in these patients included performing surgery in the afternoon, which necessitated a longer fasting time, and positioning during surgery, which would have decreased venous return. We recommend raising the lower extremities during surgery and using vasoactive agents when necessary to maintain blood pressure at an appropriate level. In our experience, asmall dose of dopamine  3–5 µg·kg<italic>–1</italic>·min<italic>–1</italic>  can be administered when necessary to elevate the blood pressure to an acceptable level.</p><p>In this study, the mean VAS score was relatively low at 6 h  2.0±0.1  but was increased at 24 h  7.8±0.5 , probably due to thewearingoff oftheregional block. Many patients had intercostal muscle traction during surgery, leading to postoperative intercostal neuralgia. The QoR-15 provides an efficient evaluation of the quality of postoperative recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) .In this study, theQoR-15 score did not differ at 6 h after surgery compared with the preoperative levels, however, itwas significantly lower at 24 h after surgery, mainly in pain-related items, which is consistent with the changes in VAS score. These results suggest that successful regional block was achieved during thoracic surgery, but that pain after surgery occurred due to weakening of the regional block, intercostal neuralgia, and perhaps otherhyperalgesicfactors. Attention should be paid to administering sufficient levels of analgesia during the recovery period.</p><p>Coughing is usually prevented during intubated general anesthesia because of neuromuscular blockade but can be triggered by excessive stretch of lung parenchyma or hilar manipulation of bronchial structuresduring non-intubated procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) .Unexpected coughing during non-intubated thoracic procedures not only impedes surgical exposure but also potentially causes life-threatening injuries to intra-thoracic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>) .Therefore, it is advisable to manipulate the lung parenchyma and hilar structures gently during surgery to avoid cough reflex during non-intubated anesthesia, particularly during major and lengthy procedures such as lobectomy or segmentectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) .We hypothesize that continuous regional block or self-controlled intravenous analgesia might partially resolve this issue, but this remains to be established.</p><p>The present study has limitations. The sample size was small and from a single center. In addition, there was nocomparisongroup. Additional studies, ideally randomized controlled trials, are necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of non-intubated anesthesia for thoracoscopy.</p><p>We concludedthat paravertebral and thoracic vagal nerve block can be achieved under direct vision through athoracoscope. Non-intubated anesthesia for thoracoscopic surgerywasfeasible and safe and reducedthe impact of surgery on the patient.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="Supplementary Material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>nullClick here to view [pdf].</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Shenzhen Basic ResearchProgram  JCYJ20150403101028161 and Shenzhen Science and Technology Research and Development Fund  JCYJ2016032816163864 .</p></sec-type></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><mixed-citation>1.
