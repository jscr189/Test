Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) provides a novel method of continuously monitoring interstitial glucose levels for up to 14 days. This study randomly assigned poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with metformin and multiple daily injections of insulin (n= 60) to either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment or CSII in combination with liraglutide (CSII + Lira) treatment for 14 days during hospitalization. GV was assessed using a FGM system; weight and cardiometabolic biomarkers were also evaluated. The coefficient of variation was significantly reduced in the CSII+Lira group (P &lt; 0.001), while no significant change was observed in the CSII group. The changes differed significantly between the two groups in mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( P=0.004), standard deviation (P=0.006), and the percentage of time in the target range (4–10 mmol/L, P=0.005 and &gt;10 mmol/L , P=0.028). The changes in mean of daily differences, interquartile range, and percentage of time in hypoglycemia (&lt;3.3 mmol/L) and hyperglycemia ( &gt; 13.9 mmol/L) identified by FGM showed no difference. Treatment with liraglutide increased serum adiponectin [33.5 (3.5, 47.7) pg/mL , P=0.003] and heme oxygenase-1 levels [0.4 ( – 0.0, 1.8) ng/mL, P=0.001] and reduced serum leptin levels [ – 2.8 (3.9 ) pg/mL, P &lt; 0.001]. Adding the g lucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutid e improved GV, weight, and some cardiometabolic risk markers. The FGM system is , therefore , shown to be a novel and useful method for glucose monitoring.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><kwd>Flash glucose monitoring</kwd><kwd>Glucagon-like peptide-1 analog</kwd><kwd>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion</kwd><kwd>Glucose fluctuation</kwd><kwd>Cardiometabolic risk markers</kwd><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec-type sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent evidence has demonstrated that insulin has ananti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory action in humans  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) . Intensive insulin therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications in the short-term and macrovascular complications after 10 years of post-trial follow-up in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes  2–4 . Short-term intensive insulin treatment could effectively optimize the sugar control profile and improve β-cell function  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B05">5</xref>) . Although an effective treatment for hyperglycemia, insulin may be associated with an increased risk of weight gainand hypoglycemia. Blood glucose monitoring is criticalforeffective diabetes management  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>) . Self-monitoring of blood glucose  SMBG , continuous glucose monitoring systems  CGMSs , andglycated hemoglobin HbA1c  are the most commonly used methods to assess short-term and long-term blood glucose control. Although SMBG has been shown to improve glycemic control when used within a structured testing regimen, it cannot predict impending hypoglycemia or alert the patient to a current hypoglycemic state. CGMSs can record real-time glycemic values and trends by providinga large number ofblood glucose recordings  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>) . However, they have not been widely used because of device limitations such as short sensor lifetimes and the need for SMBG for device calibration. HbA1c could assess glycemic control in 8–12 weeks. However, some studies have suggested that targeting HbA1c may not always result in cardiovascular benefit  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>) , which emerged in only one study during passive follow-up  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>) . One underlying reason for this discrepancy is that HbA1c cannot reflectglycemic variability GV , which is mainly due to progressive insulin deficiency, which increases with duration oftype 2 diabetes.</p><p>GV can be simply defined as the degree to which fluctuations of glucose between high  peaks  and low  nadir  levels exist. Wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels can induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which can be linked to the development of cardiovascular complications  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) . Furthermore, GV is associated with both microvascular and macrovascular endpoints in type 2 diabetes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) . Flash glucose monitoring  FGM  system byFreeStyle Libre Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., USA  has provided a new method of quantifying glycemia and GV. The sensor is applied to the skin with a handheld applicator and lasts for 14 days. In addition to updating current glucose levels in real time, FreeStyle Libresystem also usestrend arrows to provide information on the direction and rate of change in glucose levels. It is worth noting that SMBG calibration is not required during the 14-day wearing period.</p><p>Some studies have shown the accuracy and safety of FGM systems  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) .However, using a FGM system to investigate glycemic control and GV inpoorly controlledtype 2 diabetes mellitus  T2DM  treated withglucagon-like peptide-1  GLP-1  analog in combination withcontinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion CSII  therapy is rare. It has been demonstrated that CSIIisassociated with lower glucose variabilityand overall hypoglycemic events than multiple daily injections of insulin  MDI  in young adults with type 1 diabetes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) . Furthermore, GLP-1 could improve endothelial function and influence various cellular pathways including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress pathways 14, 15 . Based on this evidence, the therapeutic option of combining CSII and GLP-1 may have clinical benefit.In this study, we used FreeStyle Libre Pro  FSL-pro  for FGM to obtain blinded ambulatory glucose profile  AGP  data on blood glucose over a 14-day period at multiple time-points, and measured the levels of serum cardiometabolic risk markers at baseline and endpoint.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Design and study population</title><p>A run-in procedure was used to establish a stable baseline, familiarize candidates with procedures, and identify those unable to adhere to study requirements. The candidates received metformin and MDI  basal-bolus insulin+rapid-acting insulin analogs or premixed insulins , without any other glucose-lowering medication. Use of metformin was required with the dosage increasing from 500 mg daily to 2, 000 mg daily , as tolerated, and the dosage had to have been adjusted to 2, 000 mg daily prior to hospital admission. Patients who could not tolerate 2000 mg metformin daily were excluded. During this period, candidates performed SMBG provided by our study. The baseline characteristics of the 60 recruited individuals with T2DM are shown in Table 1. The other inclusion criteria were: a   age &gt; 20 years; b  a d iagnosis of T2DM for ≥1 year ; c received metformin and MDI for at least 2 months, without any other glucose-lowering medication ; d  HbA1c between 8 and 14%; e  fasting C-peptide ≥0.5 mg/mL  0.17 nmol/L ; and f  body mass index  BMI no t higher than 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: a   inability or unwillingness to perform FGM; b  type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus; c  severe acute or severe chronic diabetic complications; infect ion, recent trauma or surgery; d  renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine level ≥1.5 mg/dL for males or ≥1.4 mg/dL for females; e  liver dysfunction, defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels three or more times the upper limit of normal; f  serious cardiovascular disorders and current symptomatic heart failure; and g  pregnant or lactating women, or a history of pancreatitis.</p><p>This randomized, open-labeled and parallel-design study consisted of 14-day treatment periods. Subjects who were inadequately controlled with metformin and MDI were randomly assigned  through a computer-generated, random order  1:1 to one of two treatment groups: c ontrol group  CSII group  or CSII in combination with liraglutide  CSII+Lira group . All participants received metformin 2, 000 mg daily and stopped receiving MDI treatment within this period . During hospitalization, patients in the CSII+Lira group received 0.6 mg liraglutide Victoza , Denmark  subcutaneously daily to begin with, which was then increased to either 1.2 or 1.8 mg daily in combination with CSII. The detailed procedure is as follows: l iraglutide was injected starting at 0.6 mg/day; if there was no intolerance such as vomiting or nausea, the dose was increased every 3 days to 1.2 mg/day and then to 1.8 mg/day. Five patients had a transient loss of appetite at 0.6 mg/day. At 1.2 mg/day, 9 patients developed nausea and did not continue to increase the dose. At 1.8 mg/day , 1 patient developed vomiting and 1 patient developed diarrhea, however , the symptoms improved after the dosage was returned to 1.2 mg/day. In summary, 11 subjects  37%  were on 1.2 mg liraglutide per day, and 19  63%  were on 1.8 mg/day. The average dose of liraglutide used in the CSII+Lira group was 1.58 mg/day. The period of time in the study considered as the patient being on a stable dose of liraglutide was 7–11 days. All patients in the CSII+Lira group used FSL-pro for 14 days from the start of hospitalization.

Acute glucose fluctuations are closely related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, factors traditionally linked to the pathogenesis of vascular damage  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) . Previous studies have reported that glycemic fluctuation was associated with both macro- and microvascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) . Less frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels using SMBG could not alertahypoglycemic eventand may lead to inaccurate GV assessment, suggesting a lack of or a reduction in glucose fluctuations  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) . In contrast, CGM provides a better measurement of the extent of glycemic fluctuation and overall trends by providing assessments at multiple time-points  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) . However, these systems are expensive and require constant calibration. Each evaluation was extended only for 3 days, which may be too limited a time interval to fully assess clinical outcomes of interest.</p><p>In this study, weused anFGM system to obtain blinded AGP data on glucose over a 14-day period at multiple time points.The newer FGM system, which can comprehensively analyze glucose profiles, offers an alternative glucose monitoring strategy. It has some apparent advantages over other blood glucose monitoring systems. The sensor is small, light, and in mostcasesstays in place for 14 days. Therefore, when you scan you not only get a glucose reading, but can also see whether your blood glucose levels are starting to go up, down, or are stable. It is more affordable than conventional CGM devices and does not require calibration. The software allows for a consolidated overview of blood glucose levels and quantification of measured glucose exposure, stability, and variability. The reliability of theFGM systemhas been evaluated in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) .This systemis usedto explore several aspects of daily glycaemia patterns.</p><p>The resultsofour study showed that both liraglutide and CSII treatment were associated with lower glucose variability than MDI, which agreed with previous studies 13, 23 . CSII in combination with liraglutide showed a significant improvement in MAGE, CV, and SD during 14 dayscompared with CSII therapy alone. This might demonstrate that adding liraglutide to CSII therapy could result in greater improvement in GV compared with CSII therapy alone. Prospective studies of GLP-1combinationwith insulin have shown either superior or equivalent efficacy in blood glucose control compared with insulin therapy alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) . We evaluated five blood glucose ranges, which were associated with therapy outcomes relevant for patient management.During a 14-day hospitalization period, the percentagesof time when blood glucose was in 4–10, &gt;10, and &gt;13.9 mmol/Lrangeswere improved in both treatment groups, and the changes in blood glucose ranges in 4–10 and &gt;10 mmol/L were higher inthe liraglutidecombined therapy than in CSII therapy alone. This result indicated that, compared with CSII alone, CSII in combination with liraglutide treatment enabled a more favorable balance between glucose values in clinically relevant ranges. In this study, the safety of both regimens was further supported bythe absence ofepisodes of hypoglycemiarequiring medical assistance.</p><p>The combination of GLP-1 and insulin is receivinggreatattention today as a possible therapeutic choice for the management ofT2DM. In a prospective randomized study, exenatideadded to metformin and basal insulin therapy significantly reduced weight, GV, and some cardiovascular risk markers while maintaining equivalent HbA1c levels versus a rapid-acting insulin analog regimen  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) . Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog with a 97% homology with endogenous GLP-1, has been demonstrated to improve endothelial function, influence various cellular pathways including anti-inflammatory pathways, and possibly decrease oxidative stress generation. Moreover, it reduced body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure, which are critical risk factors for cardiovascular disease  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) . Specific clinical trials are needed to confirm the usefulness of this therapeutic possibility.</p><p>Inthe presentstudy, we used liraglutide as an add-on therapy to CSII in a 14-day hospitalization period. Most subjects  90%  in the liraglutide plus CSII group lost weight, with a mean weight loss of 2.5  0.5  kg. Our study supportedprevious research that showed that liraglutide improved weight reduction  23–26 . Furthermore, it has also been shown that even short-term use of liraglutide is associated with weight loss  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) . During hospital admission, the subjects received 1400–1800 kcal meals depending on their standard body weight. Therefore, the improvement in body weight may be related to the central and peripheral effects of liraglutide therapy.</p><p>Patients withT2DMwith high insulin demand have severe insulin resistance and are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. In recent years, the effects of anti-diabetic drugs on cardiometabolic risk factors have gained increasing attention  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) . The evidence that a combination of insulin and GLP-1 analog cannot only improve metabolic control but also have a favorable impact on cardiometabolic risk factors and biomarkers of diabetic patients is certainly of great interest. We found that liraglutide increased serum adiponectin levels and reduced serumleptinlevels, consistent with previous observations 27, 29 . Research has shown that GLP-1 could increaseadiponectinmRNA content and promote adiponectin secretion via the protein kinase A pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) . Leptin is the prototypical adipokine, which has been described as a potent modulator of the response to dynamic meal-related signals, whichare mediated byGLP-1 receptor. The possibility that GLP-1 might reduce the production of leptin by adipocytes remains to be confirmed, but it is a possible mechanism related to the weight loss of these patients. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study suggested that a short course of liraglutide therapy did not change body weight significantly, but there was a significant decrease in the percentage change of leptin while on liraglutide therapy compared with the placebo  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) . However, short-term effects in response to early liraglutide therapy include an increase in gastric inhibitory peptides  GIPs , which may promote theanorexigenicactions of liraglutide, whereas compensatory decreases of leptin may counteract the effects of liraglutide  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) . The corresponding changes of adiponectin and leptin levels could be coupled with a decrease in insulin resistance. HO-1 is a microsomal enzyme that can suppress oxidative stress. Some studies have shown that theanti-oxidantproperties of liraglutide may be related to the restoration of HO-1  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) .OeseburgH. et al  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)  revealed that GLP-1 can induce the expression of oxidative defense genes HO-1 and NQO1 in endothelial cells. Our study showed that liraglutide increased the serum concentrations of HO-1, which might indicate an increase inanti-oxidant capacity. Previous literature has demonstrated that GLP-1 could enhance NRF2, consequently increasingHO-1 expression against diabetic-mediated oxidation and inflammation 33, 34 . Because adiponectin, leptin, and HO-1, as well as weight, are all associated with cardiometabolic risks, these findings suggest that treatment with liraglutide might lead to medical benefits.</p><p>Serum levels of IL-6 and 8-iso-PGF2a were used to measure the status of inflammatory and oxidative stress in the body in the current study. Some studies have suggested that the combination of insulin and GLP-1 is more effective than insulin alone in improving inflammation and oxidative stress inT2DM. The levels of 8-iso-PGF2α in the two groups were significantly lower after treatment, suggesting that control of blood glucose and reduction of blood glucose fluctuations can reduce the level of oxidative stress in diabetic patients. However, there was no significant difference in the IL-6 levels and the changes in 8-iso-PGF2α levels between the two groups, which may be related to the shorter application time of liraglutide. It is also suggested that the application of liraglutide in the short term has no obvious anti-inflammatory effect.</p><p>Our studyevaluatedthe use ofthe FSL-pro for a 14-day period in a clinical environment. Information provided during a single wearing period is considered by most clinicians to be of therapeutic assistance to most patients, and AGP analysis provides a simple means to access and interpret the data captured by the system. Strengths of our study includeda direct comparison of two treatment regimens, attainment of a high rate of adherence to the protocol, direct demonstration of a reduction in GV using a FGM system, and confirmation of the safety and efficacy of the newer method of glycemic monitoring and treatment.</p><p>However, thepresent study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center study with a relatively small sample size, which may limit the statistical power when analyzing some clinical parameters. In addition, the study period was only 14 days, which may not have been sufficient to assess the additional benefits associated with GV. We need larger prospective studies withlonger durationonthe combination of CSII andliraglutide and potentially a multicenter research study to further validate our findings.</p><p>In conclusion, the addition of liraglutide to CSII therapy was superior to CSII alone in improving GV, weight, and some cardiometabolic biomarkers in patients withT2DM. The FGM systemisa novel and useful method for glucose monitoring. The safety and benefits of this therapy are still subject to large-scale, longer-duration prospective studies.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="Supplementary Material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Click here to view [pdf].</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Wethankall ofthe patients for their agreement to participate inthisstudy.</p></sec-type></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><mixed-citation>1.
