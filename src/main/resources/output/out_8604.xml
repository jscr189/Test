Despite 30 years having passed since its isolation, little is known about the neuropathology induced by the Maraba virus. Accordingly, in this study the histopathological features, inflammatory glial changes, cytokine concentrations , and nitric oxide activity in the encephalon of adult mice subjected to Maraba virus nostril infection were evaluated . The results showed that 6 days after intranasal inoculation, severe neuropathological-associated disease signs appeared, including edema , necrosis and pyknosis of neurons , generalized congestion of encephalic vessels , and intra- and perivascular meningeal lymphocytic infiltrates in several brain regions. Immunolabeling of viral antigens was observed in almost all central nervous system (CNS) areas and this was associated with intense microglial activation and astrogliosis. Compared to control animals, infected mice showed significant increases in interleukin ( IL ) -6, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α, interferon ( INF ) -γ, MCP-1, nitric oxide , and encephalic cytokine levels. We suggest that an exacerbated inflammatory response in several regions of the CNS of adult BALB/c mice might be responsible for their deaths .</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><kwd>Maraba virus</kwd><kwd>Vesiculovirus</kwd><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Astrocytes</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>Nitric oxide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec-type sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maraba virus is a member of the genus<italic>Vesiculovirus</italic>and belongs to the family<italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, which was isolated from a group of 70 female phlebotomines captured on the main road of the Serra Norte region, Parauapebas county, state of Pará, Brazil. The genus<italic>Vesiculovirus</italic>comprises 16 species, including the Indiana, New Jersey, and Alagoas viruses thatcause vesicular stomatitis in domestic animals  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) , and the Piry, Chandipura, and Isfahan viruses that causeacute febrile illness, or in more severe cases, invade the central nervous system  CNS , producing meningoencephalitis in humans  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>)</p><p>A neutralization test result suggested that a patient may have been exposed to Maraba virus  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>) .

Our previous findings with this virus species in new-born nostril-infected mice showed necrosis and pyknosis of neurons in several regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum, leading to death approximately 18 h after inoculation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref>) .</p><p>Some studies have shown that the initial inflammatory response to vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  neuroinvasion is a consequence of reactive astrocytes and microglia activation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B05">5</xref>) . The glial response to viral infections promotes increased gene expression of complement factors, cytokines, nitric oxide, and neuropeptides that may be involved in both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>) . CNS infection creates major difficulties for treatment due to the rapid onset of symptoms and disease progression with permanent or transient loss of memory, learning difficulties, and motor and sensorial deficits associated with neurodegeneration, which may end in dementia or death  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>) .</p><p>Currently, the genetically modified form - MG1  mutations in the protein M L123W and G protein Q242R  of the Maraba virus has been used as a promising oncolytic agent, with higher efficiency than that of the VSV. In an <italic>invitro</italic>study using human sarcoma tissues, MG1 infected more than 80% of the tested human sarcoma tissues, and subsequent <italic>invivo</italic>treatment in rats led to a significant increase in long-lasting cures. In addition, this procedure induced the generation of an immune memory response that provided protection against subsequent tumor growth  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>) . However, after more than thirty years since the isolation of the Maraba virus, no study has been conducted to describe neuropathological changes triggered by this virus in adult animals. Thus, we investigated this question using a murine encephalitis model induced by Maraba virus to analyze the neuroimmune and histopathological responses triggered by this infection.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The present study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research on the use of Animals of the Evandro Chagas Institute  IEC ; protocol No. 06/2013/CEUA/IEC/SVS/MS .

Viruses can also be transported axonally, as observed in a murine VSV encephalitis model in which primary infection is in the olfactory receptor neurons, followed by dissemination to the olfactory bulb and other CNS areas  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) .</p><p>Nostril inoculation of the<italic>Vesiculovirus</italic>New Jersey serotype in rats showed viral antigens caudally disseminated from the olfactory bulb, ventricular system, and central canal of the spinal cord  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) . Our results suggested that Maraba virus wasboth axonally and hematogenously disseminated in CNS areas. Indeed, Maraba virus antigens seemed to be transported from the olfactory bulb towards olfactory-adjacent areas, and they appeared on distant, unrelated CNS areas.</p><p>Here, it was shown earlier in the disease that microglial and astrocytic activation were restricted to the olfactory bulb, whereas later, after viral antigen dissemination, microglial activation and reactive astrocytosis were present in all regions where viral antigens were detected. Bi and Reiss  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>)  showed that VSV-infected  via nostril  adult BALB/c mice had astrogliosis in the olfactory bulb at 1 dpi and that microglial activation was present at 3 dpi in the olfactory bulb. Machado et al.  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)  also observed intense labelling of reactive astrocytes in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of adult C57BI6 mice after 6 days of infection with VSV. In addition, Chauhan et al.  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)  showed that the infection of astrocytes and microglia by VSV <italic>invivo</italic>induces the production of inflammatory mediators. The intensity of the glial reaction seems to be directly proportional to the production of a variety of growth factors, cytokines, NO, and neuropeptides, which, in large quantities, are associated with the development of neurodegeneration  19, 5 .</p><p>Our findings showed significant increases in the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, INF-γ, MCP-1, and NO late in disease progression, which may have contributed to cell death and lymphocytic infiltration at the end of infection. The cytokine TNF-α, for example, can induce microglial activation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)  and proliferation of astrocytes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) , followed by the expression of other cytokines, necrosis, and cellular apoptosis  22, 23 . Consistently, in the Japanese encephalitis virusmodel, TNF-α is associated with the death of neurons, as well as neutralizing antibodies involved in the reduction of virus-induced neuronal death  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) . TNF-α stimulates the production of IL-6, which together with other cytokines, IFN-γ for example, can induce reactive gliosis, local synthesis of neurotrophic factors, or even neural degeneration  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) . IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine acting in the CNS under homeostatic, inflammatory, and disease conditions, and performing dual actions  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) . Many cells in the CNS produce IL-6  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) , but astrocytes are the main producers  26, 28 . Indeed, the results of experimental viral infections <italic>invitro</italic>and <italic>invivo</italic>confirm that the main sources of IL-6 in the CNS are astrocytes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) .</p><p>Our study showed that on the sixth dpi there was an intense increase in MCP-1 levels, which may be directly related to the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the brain parenchyma, in the meninges and around the vessels. In agreement, <italic>invitro</italic>studies show that MCP-1 induces potent chemotaxis of macrophages, CD4 and CD8 activated lymphocytes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) , and effective inflammatory infiltration in inflammatory disease models  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) . In addition, MCP-1 may contribute to increased INF-γ levels because MCP-1 induces the development of the Th1 response, with consequent increases in INF-γ expression by these cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) . In addition, INF-γ may contribute to microglial activation, upregulate microglial MHC-II expression, increase phagocytosis and cytokine production  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) , and induce increased production of microglial NO  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) . Sun et al.  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)  have shown that IFN-γ strongly promotes IL-6 production <italic>invivo</italic>and significantly reduces the levels of IL-6 after the use of anti-IFN-γ antibodies. IFN-γ, which is produced primarily by activated T cells and NK cells, plays an important role in immune defense and may exert neuroprotection during viral infections  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) . However, prolonged expression of IFN-γ in the CNS can also produce damage in neurons and glial cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) . It seems that acute increases in IFN-γ levels prevent fatal encephalitis in cases of viral infection  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) ; however, in our study, increases in these cytokines were not sufficient to ameliorate the infectious process, encephalic damage, and reduced pro-inflammatory status.</p><p>Although this work showed an increase in IL-12p40 homodimer expression, a decrease in the bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimer was detected, probably due to the low IL-12p35 synthesis. Because we did not quantify this synthesis in the present work, this cause-effect relationship remains to be resolved. However, it is reasonable to suggest that the decrease of the bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimer cannot explain the progression of the inflammatory and histopathological processes generated by meningoencephalitis. In addition, our work showed that there was a significant increase in the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which occurred on the last day of the infection and perhaps because of this fact, it was not effective in reducing the inflammatory response. Indeed, IL-10 can prevent inflammation of the nervous system, but its effectiveness depends on the timing of its production  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) .</p><p>Taken together, our results suggested that the CNS dissemination of Maraba virus antigens induced an exacerbated inflammatory response characterized by intense reactive astrocytosis and microglial activation and a significant increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, INF-γ, IL-6, MCP-1, and NO, and these events led to intense clinical signs followed by death of all infected animals.</p></sec-type><sec-type sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was funded by Universidade Estadual do Pará, Instituto Evandro Chagas, and Universidade Federal do Pará.</p></sec-type></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><mixed-citation>1.
